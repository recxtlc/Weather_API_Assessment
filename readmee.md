## Project Description

This project provides a RESTful API that integrates with a weather API to retrieve weather data for a given location. The retrieved data is then stored in DynamoDB for further analysis or usage. The API provides endpoints to retrieve weather information, add new locations, and manage the stored weather data.

## Features

- Retrieve weather information for a specific location.
- Add new locations to track weather data.
- Store weather data into DynamoDB for later use.
- Manage stored weather data, such as updating or deleting records.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- AWS account with DynamoDB access
- API key for the weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # for Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate  # for Windows
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the API, you need to configure the following settings:

1. Weather API key: Obtain an API key from the weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and update the `config.py` file with your API key.

2. AWS credentials: Set up your AWS credentials either by configuring the AWS CLI or by setting the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

3. DynamoDB table: Create a DynamoDB table with the required schema (e.g., location, temperature, humidity) or modify the code to match your desired table structure. Update the `config.py` file with the appropriate table name and region.

## Usage

1. Run the API:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000` by default. You can test the API using tools like cURL or Postman.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /weather/{location}`: Retrieves the weather information for the specified location.
- `POST /locations`: Adds a new location to track weather data.
- `PUT /weather/{location}`: Updates the weather information for the specified location.
- `DELETE /weather/{location}`: Deletes the weather information for the specified location.

For detailed information about the API endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling, please refer to the API documentation (link to documentation file).
